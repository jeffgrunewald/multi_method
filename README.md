# MultiMethod

An Elixir implementation of Clojure multi methods. Dynamic dispatch of arbitrary
values, either pattern matched or computed without the need to develop structs
and protocols.

## Installation

This is highly experimental and I'm not even completely sure it's useful to anyone.
If you'd _like_ to install it, feel free via the git dependency method:

```(elixir)
{:multi_method, git: "https://github.com/jeffgrunewald/multi_method.git", branch: "master"}, 
```

Great practice with macros, though.
